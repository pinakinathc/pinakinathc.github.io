Yup !! That is me on everyone's lap. I honestly have no idea what I should write about myself but I'll try (you can help me write this section by sending your suggestions to me).<br>

As you see, I love pizza. I am a bengali boy born in a town known as Durgapur. I love to solve problems...any problem...be it fixing a toy (or rather destroying one) or imagining about how computation can help this planet (not just humans). Some of my shortcomings include: being extremely lazy, getting over-excited by a new idea, and easily distracted even by a fly !! I prioritize <b><i>doing what you love no matter the odds</i></b> above everything. I am also very stubborn meaning...I get irritated when I am unable to solve a problem which I want to solve and then solving that problem becomes imperative for me to move on with my life or everything halts around that problem (which might not always be a good thing).<br><br>
