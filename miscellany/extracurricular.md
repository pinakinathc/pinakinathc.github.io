* Like my father I love to play soccer (although he is way better than me in the game). I used to play for a local football club during junior school days. After going to high school I did play the game but occassionally when I would get time.

* I do not know why everyone, especially my parents, think I can sing and play the harmonium (have you heard Lata Mangeshkar or Manna Dey?). Somehow even some professionals singers such as Lopamudra Mitra had similar opinion and used to teach me her songs (thanks Ma'am for giving me the opportunity to learn from the best). But what I do know is I love harmonium and love to sing, not professionally but when I am around people who want to refresh themselves with some light music.

* My father had his business where he would build several things such as electrical substrations or highways etc. I loved to help him when submitting tendors and even got the opportunity to single handedly manage a project work near to 100,000 INR.

* I love motor-bikes!! Well let's just say that I learned how to ride motor-bike (both sitting on it and laying down on the seat) at a very early age (In India you should be 18+ years of age and have a driving license to ride a motor-bike). While on the bright side I was allowed to participate in a Motor-Bike rally organised by Automobile Association of Eastern India (AAEI), later when I applied for a driving license those same uncles from AAEI (who knew me and my extreme enthusiasm for motor-bike) asked me to drop my applications (I love them and they love me so I no other option :p). So even today I do not have a driving license out of my own choice...I love the way it is.

* While during my second year and beginning of third year I participated in several competitive coding competitions, in the later half of my third year, I was given the opportunity to conduct a Coding Contest in my College fest which we named: "Bug-Debug". The event had largest participation among all coding events that years AND years before it. (yes I am boasting a little :p)
