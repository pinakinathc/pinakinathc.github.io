If you are interested in doing cute work in AI/ML or finding it difficult to get into the community, you can send me a friendly email. Just say hi; no need to spend hours thinking about what to write.
I may not reply immediately. If I do not reply even after a week, send me a reminder. 
I am not the smartest researcher you will find; neither am I a "superstar" in my field.
But I will make an honest effort to help you get into the field and community.
I do not need you to have ANY background in either coding or neural networks, BUT I will demand 100% honest dedication and high ambition from you -- more than happy to give everything to chase YOUR dream.

The following is for me -- to remind myself (not super important for others):
	
<br>	
Conceptual chaos is a major problem.
Creativity demands clarity of thinking, and to think clearly about a subject requires an organized understanding of how its pieces fit together. 
Organization and clarity also lead to better communication with others.
Academics often say they are paid to think and understand, but that is not true. 
They are paid to think, understand, and communicate their findings. -- David I. Spivak

<!-- Hierarchies of features are less suited to challenges such as language, inference, and high-level planning.
For example, as Noam Chomsky famously pointed out, language is filled with sentences you haven't seen before.
Pure classifier systems don't know what to do with such sentences. The talent of feature detectors -- in
identifying which member of some category something belongs to -- doesn't translate into understanding novel
sentences, in which each sentence has its own unique meaning. <b>Source:</b> <a href='https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/marcusquote.html'>https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/marcusquote.html</a>
