Here is a non-exhaustive list of my non-research projects. My research work can be found <a href="/research">here</a>. You can also check out my Github profile <a href="">here</a> for a complete list of my projects.

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Health_Hack</b>: This application is all about using a very common sensor: accelerometer; which is present in most android devices. Based on readings from the sensor, one can approximately estimate where the user is walking slowly, briskly or running. Hence, it can give a (very crude) estimate of calories burnt. The android application keeps logs of calories burnt each day with an option to clear logs. Apart from this, a major application of this sensor is an alarm system. Say, an individual falls on the ground and looses consciousness, a hopefully sharp spike can act as an alarm system informing local security of a probable medical emergency.<br>
