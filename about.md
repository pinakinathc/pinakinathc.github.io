Namaste!! I am Pinaki Nath Chowdhury, a bengali born in an industrial city known as Durgapur.
I completed my schooling in St. Xavier's School, Durgapur. Then, I joined D.A.V Model School Durgapur to complete my High School before finally joining Kalyani Government Engineering College for my undergraduate studies.

I love music and learned how to play the harmonium. But did not pursue it as a career because I loved solving puzzles and wondering about nature (seems to cinematic right?)

You know, if you get time, you should learn 2 things:


(1) Bengali (how to read). We bengalis love to read and write and there are some amazing novels written in bengala (some got the Nobel Prize too!!)

(2) Learn how to play the harmonium. The thing with this instrument is: if you play it without soul, it would neither look nor sound that cool. But with a little magic, it can actually take you to a world where you forget about your worries and all those depressing moments in your life. (Some told me that my neighbours would listen me play the harmonium in the morning, but I believe, they were mostly angry than tranquil :p)

Okay so back to the present, now I am working as a "Project Linked Person" at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unit in Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.

If you are confused with the job title, then you can think of it as Research Assistant. My day to day work involves thinking about problems related to Computer Vision (though more often than not, we tend to work on problems related to Scene Text or Handwritten Text detection/recognition problems).

Actually, I was into programming before joining ISI Kolkata, working with various people developing new applications or softwares from 2nd year of my undergraduate studies. I love 2 things very much: work with other people (you know it nice to work with smart and funny people), and travel !!

More than staying in an luxury hotel, I prefer to live in descent hotels or hostels and travel with the locals to their places. You know live the life of the locals, eat like them, dress like them, sing like them and most important, have a hearty laugh with them.

I have been to several places in India with my family like Delhi, Chennai, Kanyakumari, Shimla, Haridwar, Rotan Pass, Rameshwaram, Pondicherry, Puri. Later I worked as a programmer for some teams in Bangalore and Hyderabad (hence got to love their way of life too!!).

Well, now I want to explore the life of people outside my home country. I have worked with some people who lives in Malaysia, Sweden, London, Zurich, Norway, Sydney, and some in the US also. Hey!! have you lived in Kolkata yet? Its a pretty historical place and we lovingly call it "the city of joy".
