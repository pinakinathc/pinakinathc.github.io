LP-Night dataset containing photos with license plates captured at night.


## LP Night Dataset

---

### Dataset Description

This dataset was introduced in the paper "A new augmentation-based method for text detection in night and day license plate images" and "A new U-net based license plate enhancement model in night and day images". It includes images of different vehicles, blur, multi-script, imbalanced illumination, orientation, and perspective. The images have a resolution {Min: (2067 x 2066); Max: (3120 x 4160) } and are taken at night.

### Annotation Format

The dataset folder contains images with filenames as `IMG_XXXXXXXX_XXXXXX.jpg` and annotations as `IMG_XXXXXXXX_XXXXXX.xml`. The xml files look like the following:

```
<annotation>
	<folder>lp_data_100</folder>
	<filename>IMG_XXXXXXXX_XXXXXX.jpg</filename>
	<path>/home/pinaki/work/acpr_conf/training_data/lp_data_100/IMG_XXXXXXXX_XXXXXX.jpg.jpg</path>

```
If we are unable to read the text region (i.e., it is not legible), then we use `<name>###</name>` in the xml fields.
