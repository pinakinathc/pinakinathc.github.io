AMLPR dataset containing 1501 photos where photo contains multiple license plates of different types of cars and motorbikes.


## AMLPR Dataset

---

### Dataset Description
This dataset was proposed in the paper "Graph Attention Network for Detecting License Plates in Crowded Street Scenes". It includes images of different types of cars and motorbikes. Unlike existing license plate datasets, ours contain dense vehicles including different cars and motorbikes in a single image. This increases complexity of license plate detection since there are high chances of occlusion. In addition, there is degradation due to defocus of the camera on the many vechicles.
