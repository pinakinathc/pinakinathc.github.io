*This is a work in progress. In this blog, I will try to understand why circuits are universal function approximators. Does this result have some inherent assumptions that we often ignore? If you think of it more carefully (given my background is not in mathematics), this is a striking and a tall claim. Currently, I am busy with some submissions, but my target is to complete this blog before the end of this year.*
