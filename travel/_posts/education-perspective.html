  <h1>Is education really universal -- or do we truly want it?</h1>

        tl/dr: my goal is to ask a few questions centered around -- is education really free or not. I shall highlight some unsaid "rules" that we as a society follow. 
        As a disclaimer, I must mention that personally, I believe that education should be free -- from everything and from everyone. Set education free -- TRULY.
