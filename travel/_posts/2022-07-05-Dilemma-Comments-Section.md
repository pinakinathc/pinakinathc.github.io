<h2>Topic: The dilemma between anonymity with complete freedom of speech v/s moderation with surveillance.</h2>

I personally believe the internet should be free in every aspect -- that includes freedom of access (no censorship) and freedom from surveillance (anonymity). It is no surprise that I believe down the line -- using Tor (what today people foolishly call the "dark web") will become the norm. 

<b>Coming back to why I am posting:</b> I was revamping my website and wanted to make the "Comments Section" accessible to anyone without requiring any sign-in or sign-up (which kills anonymity and freedom of speech to a great extent).

<b>Problem:</b> If I remove the sign-up process, random bots or more unfortunately humans themselves would spam the comments section with potentially harmful content -- a problem faced by the Tor community.

Theoretically, I could spend countless days developing a "Comments Filter bot" but honestly, neither do I have the time nor the will because I still believe humans should learn to respect and stop themselves from harming others. The Internet represents democracy at its best -- it works best when its citizens are responsible.

<b>My dilemma:</b> should I embrace democracy by making the "Comments Section" on my website free to everyone and remove the sign-in or sign-up process (and thereby risk harmful spam) or should I take the easier path and keep things the way they are -- force people to sign-in or sign-up so that I can act as a dictator and monitor malicious posts.
